#Â Firebase gmail auth

This library is supposed to be a tiny helper to wrap firebase and being able to login with gmail in any tiny little html app to be able to use the JWT for API calls.


Before anything else your project needs to import the following three files, two of which are firebase and one, this library:
```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.3.2/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.3.2/firebase-auth.js"></script>
<script src="..."></script>
```
